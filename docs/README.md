# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation! This guide provides an overview of our project management approach and links to detailed process documents that help teams deliver value efficiently and consistently.

## Introduction

OctoAcme's project management framework is designed to enable cross-functional teams to deliver product features, services, and integrations with clarity, quality, and customer focus. Our approach emphasizes lightweight processes, clear ownership, and continuous improvement, allowing teams to adapt quickly while maintaining alignment with business goals.

Whether you're a new team member or an experienced contributor, these documents provide the guidance you need to understand how we plan, execute, and deliver projects at OctoAcme.

## Core Principles

Our project management approach is built on five foundational principles:

- **Customer-first**: We prioritize customer value and usability in every decision. Understanding and meeting customer needs drives our work.

- **Iterative delivery**: We deliver small, testable increments that provide value early and often, enabling faster feedback and course correction.

- **Clear ownership**: Every project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead, ensuring accountability and clear decision-making authority.

- **Data-informed decisions**: We measure impact and iterate based on evidence, using metrics to guide priorities and validate outcomes.

- **Psychological safety**: We foster an environment where team members can share feedback, ask questions, and learn from both successes and failures without fear.

## Project Lifecycle

OctoAcme projects follow a structured lifecycle with five key phases:

1. **Initiation**: Define the problem statement, identify stakeholders, and establish success criteria. Create a project one-pager and get initial approval.

2. **Planning**: Break work into actionable tasks, create a prioritized backlog, estimate effort, identify dependencies, and establish a release plan.

3. **Execution & Tracking**: Build, test, and review features iteratively. Track progress through standups, demos, and project boards while managing risks and blockers.

4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy validated features to production with proper testing, monitoring, and rollback plans in place.

5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**: Capture learnings, celebrate successes, and identify actionable improvements for future work.

## Key Roles

OctoAcme projects involve multiple roles working collaboratively:

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and verify acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide input, feedback, and approvals

For detailed role descriptions and responsibilities, see the [Roles and Personas Guide](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md).
