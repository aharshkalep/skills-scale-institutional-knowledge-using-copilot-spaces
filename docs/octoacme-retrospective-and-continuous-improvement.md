# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- **Facilitator**: Project Manager (or rotate among team members)
- **Participants**: Include all relevant roles (Developers, QA, DevOps, UX, Technical Writer, Product Manager, Business Analyst, Customer Support representative)
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- **Capture role-specific feedback**: What worked well or needs improvement for each function (development, testing, design, documentation, deployment, support)

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- **Owner** (specific role from [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)):
- Due date:
- Success criteria:
- **Cross-functional dependencies** (if any):
- **Stakeholder impact** (who benefits from this improvement):

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes
- **Cross-functional learning**: Share insights across roles (e.g., DevOps teaches developers about deployment automation, UX shares user research findings)
- **Document patterns**: Technical Writer captures reusable processes and lessons learned
- **Feedback loops**: Customer Support shares user pain points, Business Analyst measures outcome improvements
