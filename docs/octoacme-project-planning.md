# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives

- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. **Cross-functional kickoff meeting** with stakeholders and full delivery team (PM, PdM, developers, DevOps, QA, UX, Technical Writer, Business Analyst, Support liaison)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) with input from QA and DevOps
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
7. **UX Designer**: Create design specifications and user flows for features
8. **Technical Writer**: Plan documentation scope and delivery timeline
9. **DevOps Engineer**: Review infrastructure needs, CI/CD requirements, and deployment strategy
10. **Business Analyst**: Validate requirements map to business objectives and define success metrics
